# image-splitter

note: initiates program to the size of the image so if it's too big then the program will have some problems. I'll fix it later (surely).

just a small program I decided to make one day cuz I wanted to split an image for an osu collab
usage instructions are printed in console

the splitting algorithm uses indexes to decide which lines block others. higher index lines are placed inside a box formed by a lower index line. basically just box subdivision.
